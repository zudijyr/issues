# Equality for All

Plain and simple, Dave supports full equality for all citizens, including lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT), asexual, and polyamorous citizens. The federal government needs to act to protect all citizens equally.

- Direct the federal government to stop providing special benefits for married couples, since these discriminate unfairly against unmarried people.
- Extend federal non-discrimination laws to include sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression.
- Include bullying and harrassment prevention in federal programs that support school safety
